## [Hotel Booking Analysis Using Python](https://github.com/Laxman-Parab/Hotel_Booking_Analysis_Using_Python/blob/main/Hotel_Booking_Analysis.ipynb)
- Focused on spatial analysis and data cleaning on dataset obtained from kaggle.
- Analysed the price variation of hotels, guest preference and special requests done by the guests using libraries like plotly, seaborn and matplotlib.
- Created a pivot table to display the special request and cancellation of the guests.
- Discovered the most busy month and the month in which many bookings were cancelled.
